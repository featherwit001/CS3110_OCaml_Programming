type nat =
  | Z
  | S of nat

let rec plus a b =
  match a with
  | Z -> b
  | S k -> S (plus k b)

Claim: forall n, plus n Z = n

Proof: by induction on n.
P(n) = plus n Z = n

Base case: n = Z
Show: plus Z Z = Z
  plus Z Z
={evaluation}
  Z

Inductive case: n = S k
IH: plus k Z = k
Show:  plus k Z = k

  plus (S k) Z
={evaluation}
  S (plus k Z)
={IH}
  S k
